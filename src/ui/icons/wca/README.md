# WCA Vector Icons for React Native

The folks over at the World Cube Association and cubing.js have made
some great [cubing icons](https://github.com/cubing/icons).

This project is the result of using IcoMoon to organize them into three
separate fonts:

- Official Events
- Unofficial Events
- Infractions

The following tutorial was especially helpful during the process:
https://three29.com/how-to-use-react-native-vector-icons-to-add-custom-icons-to-a-react-native-app/

## CONTRIBUTING

Go to https://icomoon.io/app and restore the WCAIcons.json to recover
the project and make the changes/improvements you want to see there!

## LICENSE

MPL-2.0

Note, the icons themselves are from the
[cubing/icons]((https://github.com/cubing/icons) project which is MIT
licensed. My work here is just the pieces for React Native. If you need
a more permissive license, it is not too hard to reproduce the work I've
done here.
